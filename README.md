Definitely not a ripoff of Swiggy which uses SQL to maintain the backend database of restaurants, customers, payments and everything relevant for a food delivery app. This was part of our course project in 4th sem DBMS. Partners - Jeeva Jayaprakash and Muhamed Rizwan.

Unfortunately there is no working demo present here because this database was not created on my laptop (kept crashing), rather on Jeeva's. But all the SQL files we sat and coded together are here.
